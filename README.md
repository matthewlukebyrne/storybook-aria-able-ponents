### Component Building using a series of tools and processes with information listed below

Styled Components -

https://styled-components.com/

Utilising tagged template literals (a recent addition to JavaScript) and the power of CSS, styled-components allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also removes the mapping between components and styles â€“ using components as a low-level styling construct could not be easier!

Styled Components Modifiers

Styled Components are incredibly useful when building an application, but the community lacks guidelines and best practices for how to structure, organize, and modify a component library. Fortunately, the CSS ecosystem has several solutions for this, including the very well-thought-out Block, Element, Modifier (BEM) conventions.
