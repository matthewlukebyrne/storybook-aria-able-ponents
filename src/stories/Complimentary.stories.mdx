## Usage

The complementary landmark role is used to designate a supporting section that relates to the main content, yet can stand alone when separated. These sections are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes. If possible, use the HTML aside element instead.


## Description

The complementary role is a landmark role. Landmarks can be used by assistive technology to quickly identify and navigate to large sections of the document. 
Content listed within a container with the complementary landmark role should make sense if separated from the main content of the document.

Landmark roles are intended to be used sparingly, to identify larger overall sections of the document. Using too many landmark roles can create "noise" in screen readers, making it difficult to understand the overall layout of the page.
