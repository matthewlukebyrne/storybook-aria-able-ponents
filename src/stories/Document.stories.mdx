## Usage

Generally used in complex composite widgets or applications, the document role can inform assistive technologies to switch context to a reading mode: 
The document role tells assistive technologies with reading or browse modes to use the document mode to read the content contained within this element.

## Description

By default, web pages are treated as documents; assistive technologies (AT) enter browse or read mode when entering a new web page. This mode can be altered through various roles, including the widget and application roles. The document role brings the AT back into browse or read mode. 

Generally placed within an application role or other interactive widget role, the document role is used to indicate a section of a complex composite widget that an assistive technology user should read using its browse or virtual reading mode, if available.

Because ATs with reading mode default to that mode for all elements except for those with a widget or application role set, document role is only useful for focusable elements within a widget or application that should be read as static rich text. 

Adding role="document" and tabindex="0" to the element containing the text within a widget enables the screen reader user to press the Tab key to place focus on the document element and read the text with the screen reader's reading cursor.
