## Usage

A feed is a dynamic scrollable list of articles in which articles are added to or removed from either end of the list as the user scrolls. 
A feed enables screen readers to use the browse mode reading cursor to both read and scroll through a stream of rich content that may continue scrolling infinitely by loading more content as the user reads.


## Description

A feed is a page structure for a scrollable list of articles where scrolling may cause articles to be added to the top or end of the list. 

The list establishes an interoperability contract between the web page and assistive technologies that governs scroll interactions so that assistive technology users can read articles, jump forward and backward by article, and reliably trigger new articles to load while in reading mode. 

Examples include an RSS feed, news feeds, social media feeds like Facebook, Instagram or Twitter, or even a list of related products on an eCommerce page. 

These streams can be limited or infinite, loading more content as the user scrolls. Implementing the feed pattern allows a screen reader to reliably read and trigger the loading of feed content while in reading mode.
