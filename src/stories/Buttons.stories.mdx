# ARIA: button role

The button role should be used for clickable elements that trigger a response when activated by the user. 
Adding role="button" will make an element appear as a button control to a screen reader. 
This role can be used in combination with the aria-pressed attribute to create toggle buttons.

## Description

The button role identifies an element as a button to screen readers. 
A button is a widget used to perform actions such as submitting a form, opening a dialog, cancelling an action, or performing a command such as inserting a new record or displaying information.

    <PrimaryButton disabled={boolean("Disabled", false)} onClick={action('button-click')}>

    </PrimaryButton>
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Secondary
