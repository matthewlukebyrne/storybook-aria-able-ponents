## Usage

The search landmark role is used to identify a section of the page used to search the page, site, or collection of sites.

## Description

Landmarks can be used by assistive technology to quickly identify and navigate to large sections of the document. 

The search role is added to the container element that encompasses the items and objects that, as a whole, combine to create search functionality. 

When a form is a search form, use the search role instead of form. 

If a document includes more than one search, each should have a unique label. While there is a input of type search, there is no HTML element that defines a search landmark.
